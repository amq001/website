As a result, daily infrastructure costs dropped from €600 per day to under €100 per day, while preserving smooth gameplay, real-time multiplayer interactions, and transparent in-game transactions. This optimization enabled the client to scale sustainably and reinvest resources into product growth instead of infrastructure overhead.`,
